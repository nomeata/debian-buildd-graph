Debian Buildd Graph
===================

This small script plots the number and buildtimes of uploads of the buildd
system. It can be accessed at https://buildd.debian.org/stats/graph/

This was created by Joachim Breitner <nomeata@debian.org> and the source can be
obtained via [git](http://git.nomeata.de/?p=debian-buildd-graph.git).
Improvements are welcome, especially with regard to the HTML styling.
